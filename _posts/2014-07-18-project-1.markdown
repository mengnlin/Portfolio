description: EventMaster is an Eventbrite clone site. EventMaster used Ruby on Rails for the backend, PostgreSQL as database, React, Redux and javaScript for the frontend. This one-page web-application came with RESTful APIs for CRUD operations. Bcryt password hashing function and salt are used to prevent rainbow table attack. In addition, I leveraged AWS S3 cloud service to store uploaded images and reduce server load. Furthermore, I also used a UI development tool called Storybook to build portable React components and UI design independently.
